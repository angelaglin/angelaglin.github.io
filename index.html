		<p> Welcome to my website! I am a fifth year PhD candidate at the Operations Research Center at MIT, advised by Professor Georgia Perakis. Prior to graduate school, I completed my undergraduate studies at Rice University, majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics and minoring in Mathematics.
		<br>
		<p> I’m broadly interested in data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty in healthcare domains, such as patient treatment, hospital operations, and public health. My current research aims to leverage data and models to make better clinical decisions that lead to improved patient outcomes. In collaboration with Tampa General Hospital, I use reinforcement learning methods to learn robust strategies for treating patients with sepsis, as well as use stochastic optimization and Markov Decision Processes to make dynamic resource allocation decisions within hospitals.  
		<br>
		<p> I am grateful to be supported by the MIT Health and Life Sciences (HEALS) Collaborative Graduate Fellowship.
